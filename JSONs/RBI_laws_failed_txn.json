        "LegalTrainingMaterial": "Indian courts and the RBI have imposed heightened duty of care by banks towards senior citizens  as they are susceptible to deceit and trickery and are not expected to be adept with advanced technology and operations requiring technical knowledge and finesse. India law and RBI standards emphasise the importance of protective measures to be adopted by the banks (including procedural  technical and logical) for senior citizens who may not be as equipped to handle complex electronic banking interfaces or defend against fraudulent transactions employing deceptive tactics. This includes the responsibility to provide immediate assistance and take swift action in cases of reported failed transactions. It is very much possible that my case is not an isolated case  and the bank must have encountered many similar cases. It is on the bank to demonstrate what actions it has taken to deploy proactive tools and technology to protect the senior citizens."
