This compliance suggests that the bank acknowledges its role in the incident and its responsibility to remedy the loss suffered by the customer."}
{"prompt":"How important is the relationship between a customer and a bank in determining liability for unauthorized withdrawals?","completion":"The relationship between a customer and their bank is crucial in determining liability. If you have an account with a particular bank (SBI in this scenario), and there's no direct relationship with another bank (like HDFC Bank), then the liability for unauthorized transactions typically rests with your bank, due to the direct consumer-service provider relationship."}

It suggests the bank recognizes its role or fault in the unauthorized transactions."}
{"prompt":"How does a bank's negligence in safeguarding account security affect its liability?","completion":"A bank's negligence in safeguarding account security directly affects its liability for any resulting unauthorized transactions. The commission found SBI negligent in protecting Sh. Badar Singh's account, leading to the bank being held solely responsible for the losses."}
{"prompt":"What should a customer do if they don't receive transaction alerts for unauthorized withdrawals?","completion":"If a customer doesn't receive transaction alerts for unauthorized withdrawals, they should immediately report the oversight to their bank and document all communications. This could be vital evidence in proving the bank's service deficiency."}
{"prompt":"How does the direct consumer relationship with a bank influence the outcome of unauthorized withdrawal cases?","completion":"The direct consumer relationship with a bank significantly influences the outcome of unauthorized withdrawal cases.

Badar Singh's?","completion":"Legal precedents that establish liability in cases where there's no direct consumer relationship with the party against whom a complaint is made support decisions like in Sh.

{"prompt":"Can a customer be held liable for unauthorized transactions if they have not acted negligently?","completion":"A customer cannot be held liable for unauthorized transactions if they have not acted negligently. If the customer, like Sh. Badar Singh, has not contributed to the unauthorized withdrawal through negligence or fraud, the liability falls on the bank."}
{"prompt":"What does it mean for a bank to breach RBI's prescribed limits for daily ATM withdrawals?","completion":"A bank breaching RBI's prescribed limits for daily ATM withdrawals indicates a significant oversight or failure in its operational controls. Such a breach not only violates regulatory guidelines but also contributes to the bank's liability in cases of unauthorized withdrawals."}
{"prompt":"How can customers protect themselves against unauthorized transactions?","completion":"Customers can protect themselves by regularly monitoring their account activities, setting up transaction alerts, using secure banking methods, and immediately reporting any unauthorized transactions to their bank."}

{"prompt":"How does a bank's argument that a matter involves fraud affect its liability?","completion":"A bank's argument that a matter involves fraud does not automatically absolve it of liability, especially if there's no evidence of the customer's negligence or involvement in the fraud.

It was referenced in Ms. Chawla's case to highlight the bank's legal obligations."}
{"prompt":"Can the bank refuse to refund me for a fraudulent transaction by blaming me for the disclosure of my PIN?","completion":"Not necessarily. Even though customers must keep their PIN confidential, the bank's negligence, like not promptly blocking the card or failing to provide security footage, can lead to their liability, as seen in Ms. Chawla's case."}

{"prompt":"What are the reasons for UPI transactions being declined during address resolution or authorisation?","completion":"UPI transactions can be declined due to several reasons such as maximum connections or requests open at the beneficiary bank, a high number of credit request open at the beneficiary bank, and high response time at the beneficiary bank. These are monitored through a dynamic throttling mechanism by NPCI to manage the transaction flow effectively."}
{"prompt":"What is dynamic throttling in the context of UPI transactions?","completion":"Dynamic throttling is a mechanism enabled by NPCI at the central level to manage UPI transactions efficiently. It declines transactions based on specific parameters like maximum connections at the beneficiary bank, number of open credit requests, and high response times, to reduce customer complaints and disputes from timeout transactions."}
{"prompt":"How does dynamic throttling benefit UPI transactions?","completion":"Dynamic throttling helps in reducing the number of deemed approved transactions by treating potential ones as declined, thus not routing them to the beneficiary bank. This mechanism aims to decrease transaction timeouts and declines, improving the overall success rate of UPI payments."}
{"prompt":"Are banks and PSPs allowed to decline UPI transactions due to their own throttling?","completion":"No, payer and payee Payment Service Providers (PSPs) or their partner apps are not allowed to decline transactions due to throttling at their end.
