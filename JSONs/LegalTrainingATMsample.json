      "Answers": "[six digit number]",
      "Parameter": "pincode",
      "Condition": "If the pincode belongs to rural / semi-urban district ",
      "LegalTrainingMaterial": "Bank is well aware that I belong to a rural / semi-urban area where the financial literacy is assumed to be low  and customers from these areas are more susceptible to frauds. There is a heightened duty casted on the banks to implement robust technological solutions to protect the vulnerable customers especially those from rural / semi-urban areas from financial frauds. The bank should be called upon to demonstrate what additional technology and security parameters the bank has put in place to protect the customers from rural / semi-urban areas from the financial frauds."

      "Question": "Are you a senior citizen i.e. is your age above 60 years",
      "Answers": "Yes/No",
      "Parameter": "senior_citizen",
      "Condition": "Yes",
      "LegalTrainingMaterial": "Indian courts and the RBI have imposed heightened duty of care by banks towards senior citizens  as they are susceptible to deceit and trickery  and are not expected to be adept with advanced technology and operations requiring technical knowledge and finesse. India law and RBI standards emphasise the importance of protective measures to be adopted by the banks (including procedural  technical and logical) for older customers  who may not be as equipped to handle complex electronic banking interfaces or defend against fraudsters employing deceptive tactics. This includes the responsibility to provide immediate assistance and take swift action in cases of reported fraud. It is very much possible that my case is not an isolated case  and the bank must have encountered many similar cases. It is on the bank to demonstrate what actions it has taken to deploy proactive tools and technology to protect the senior citizens."

      "Answers": "Yes/No",
      "Parameter": "pensionner",
      "Condition": "Yes",
      "LegalTrainingMaterial": "The duty of the bank gets further heightened when the bank is aware that the account is the pensioner account of a senior citizen  which is usually used by the senior citizens for their livelihood. RBI has time and again emphasised that senior citizens form an important constituent of the bank  and the entire trust of senior citizens in the banking systems will go down if the highly capitalized banks do not implement proactive and preventive technologies to safeguard the bank accounts of senior citizens especially where senior citizens receive their pensions to survive and sustain in the old age."

      "Question": "Did you ever apply for an ATM card from your bank?",
      "Answers": "Yes/No",
      "Parameter": "applied_for_atm",
      "Condition": "No",
      "LegalTrainingMaterial": "This is a prima facie case of utter gross negligence and mala fide intent at the bank's side which may involve connivance of the bank's officers  including unauthorizedly sharing my information to cause wrongful harm to me. RBI has specifically prohibited banks to issue unsolicited cards. The onus is on the bank to demonstrate that I have applied for the ATM card  including matching my signatures (if they have received a physical application) or digital logs for my consent to issue the ATM card  and that the ATM card was delivered to my address and received by me  and that I have set up the ATM pin using the technologies which are in my control and possession. The RBI has also mandated banks to not share customer information  and in this case the bank or its employee has shared the information to cause wrongful loss to the user. In fact  the Supreme Court has also held that the development in means of communication  science & technology etc. have led to an enormous increase in economic crimes viz. phishing  ATM frauds etc. which are being committed by intelligent but devious individuals involving huge sums of public or government money. These are actually public wrongs or crimes committed against society and the gravity and magnitude attached to these offences is concentrated on the public at large."

      "Answers": "Yes/No",
      "Parameter": "regular-withdrawing",
      "Condition": "No",
      "LegalTrainingMaterial": "To the best of my recollection  I am not withdrawing any money from the ATM from where the fraudulent transaction occurred. The bank is required by the RBI guidelines to implement robust surveillance / monitoring of card transactions and transaction velocity and transaction behavior. As I am not frequently withdrawing or have withdrawn any money from the ATM  it was incumbent on the bank to have pro-actively implemented other security measures to ensure the transaction is not fraud. Failing to do so has caused this loss to me."

      "Answers": "Yes/No",
      "Parameter": "atm-pin-shared",
      "Condition": "No",
      "LegalTrainingMaterial": "This is a prima facie case of utter gross negligence and mala fide intent at the bank's side which may involve connivance of the bank's officer  including unauthorizedly sharing my information to cause wrongful harm to me. The onus is on the bank to demonstrate how a different person has withdrawn the money from the ATM by using my ATM pin. The RBI has also mandated banks to not share customer information  and in this case there could be a possibility that the bank or its employee has access to my ATM card Pin and have shared the information to cause wrongful loss to me  or the bank's systems were not strong to prevent a third party to access my ATM card Pin and undertake a fraudulent transaction. In fact  the Supreme Court has also held that the development in means of communication  science & technology etc. have led to an enormous increase in economic crimes viz. phishing  ATM frauds etc. which are being committed by intelligent but devious individuals involving huge sums of public or government money. These are actually public wrongs or crimes committed against society and the gravity and magnitude attached to these offences is concentrated on the public at large."
