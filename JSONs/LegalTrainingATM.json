There is a heightened duty casted on the banks to implement robust technological solutions to protect the vulnerable customers especially those from rural / semi-urban areas from financial frauds. The bank should be called upon to demonstrate what additional technology and security parameters the bank has put in place to protect the customers from rural / semi-urban areas from the financial frauds."

        "LegalTrainingMaterial": "Indian courts and the RBI have imposed heightened duty of care by banks towards senior citizens  as they are susceptible to deceit and trickery  and are not expected to be adept with advanced technology and operations requiring technical knowledge and finesse. India law and RBI standards emphasise the importance of protective measures to be adopted by the banks (including procedural  technical and logical) for senior citizens who may not be as equipped to handle complex electronic banking interfaces or defend against fraudsters employing deceptive tactics. This includes the responsibility to provide immediate assistance and take swift action in cases of reported fraud. It is very much possible that my case is not an isolated case  and the bank must have encountered many similar cases. It is on the bank to demonstrate what actions it has taken to deploy proactive tools and technology to protect the senior citizens."

RBI has specifically prohibited banks to issue unsolicited ATM cards. The onus is on the bank to demonstrate that I have applied for the ATM card  including matching my signatures (if they have received a physical application) or digital logs for my consent to issue the ATM card  and that the ATM card was delivered to my address and received by me  and that I have set up the ATM pin using the technologies which are in my control and possession. The RBI has also mandated banks to not share customer information  and in this case the bank or its employee has shared the information to for fradulently issuing ATM card to me which I have never applied for the ATM card, which caused wrongful loss to the user. In fact the Supreme Court has also held that the development in means of communication  science & technology etc. have led to an enormous increase in economic crimes viz. phishing  ATM frauds etc. which are being committed by intelligent but devious individuals involving huge sums of public or government money.

The bank is required by the RBI guidelines to implement robust surveillance / monitoring of card transactions and transaction velocity and transaction behavior. As I am not frequently withdrawing neither have withdrawn any money from the ATM it was incumbent on the bank to have pro-actively implemented other security measures to ensure the transaction is not fraud.

The onus is on the bank to demonstrate how a different person has withdrawn the money from the ATM by using my ATM pin which I never shared. The RBI has also mandated banks to not share customer information  and in this case there could be a possibility that the bank or its employee has access to my ATM card Pin and have shared the ATM details and ATM Pin to cause wrongful loss to me or the bank's systems were not strong to prevent a third party to access my ATM card Pin and undertake a fraudulent transaction.

Moreover  as per the RBI guidelines and settled legal principles a mere sharing of PIN or passcodes by customer does not absolve bank from getting away from its primary duty to implement adequate monitoring / surveillance and other technologies to prevent the frauds in the account of the customer.

        "LegalTrainingMaterial": "As per the RBI guidelines and settled legal principles a mere delayed intimation of the transaction by customer does not absolve bank from getting away from its primary duty to implement adequate monitoring / surveillance and other technologies to prevent the frauds in the account of the customer. Even if there is contributory negligence by the customer which in this case is a mere delayed intimation between 4 to 7 days, the bank is still fully liable to compensate the customer if the bank has been found negligent or there is a deficiency in service by the bank to protect the account of the customer. As per RBI guidelines the onus of proof is on the bank that the fraudulent transaction occurred due to sole negligence of the customer and there was no negligence from the bank's side  and that the bank should also be asked to demonstrate what actions and investigations it had undertaken to recover the money from the fraudulent person or from the account of the beneficiary or thereafter if there is a chain of onward transactions. In fact  the Supreme Court has also held that the development in means of communication  science & technology etc. have led to an enormous increase in economic crimes viz. phishing  ATM frauds etc. which are being committed by intelligent but devious individuals involving huge sums of public or government money. These are actually public wrongs or crimes committed against society and the gravity and magnitude attached to these offences is concentrated on the public at large."
