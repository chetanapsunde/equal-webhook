There is a heightened duty casted on the banks to implement robust technological solutions to protect the vulnerable customers especially those from rural / semi-urban areas from financial frauds.

The bank is also under duty to protect senior citizens from any UPI related frauds and deceit by working closely with the UPI App service providers. Indian law and RBI standards emphasise the importance of protective measures to be adopted by the banks (including procedural, technical and logical) for older customers, who may not be as equipped to handle complex electronic banking interfaces or defend against fraudsters employing deceptive tactics. This includes the responsibility to provide immediate assistance and take swift action in cases of reported fraud. A similar duty is casted on the UPI App providers when they are dealing with senior citizens. It is very much possible that my case is not an isolated case, and the bank and/or UPI App provider must have encountered many similar cases. It is on the bank and/or UPI App provider to demonstrate what actions it / they has / have taken to deploy proactive tools and technology to protect the senior citizens"
